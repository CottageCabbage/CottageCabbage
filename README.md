ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CottageCabbage], feel free to reach me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CottageCabbage), [Telegram](https://t.me/CottageCabbage) or [Email](CottageCabbage@protonmail.com)

## Goals
Making my own Pomodoro Timer. Still unfamiliar with Typescript & Vue, but will try studying from the repos below, they're my favorites.
+ https://github.com/roldanjr/pomatez (Typescript)
+ https://github.com/karimdaghari/pomotroid (Vue)
+ https://github.com/gnome-pomodoro/gnome-pomodoro (Vala?? Never heard about it. Saving just in case)

I'd be really thankful for any other great repo to learn from.

## Interests
I like baking and also books. Bread + Cosmic Horror, specifically. 

## Learning
Currently going through freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) and Coursera's [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) courses. As soon as possible, will also try starting on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
