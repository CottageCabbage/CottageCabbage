ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CottageCabbage, feel free to reach me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CottageCabbage), [Telegram](https://t.me/CottageCabbage) or Discord (CottageCabbage#2751).

## Goals
+ Making my own Pomodoro Timer. See TomatoSalad repo
+ Diary App, like [this one](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/mini-diary), more markdown.

## Interests
I like baking and also books. Bread and Cosmic Horror, that is.

## Learning
I'm currently going through Coursera's [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course while trying to finish freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) Projects. As soon as possible, I also will try to start on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
